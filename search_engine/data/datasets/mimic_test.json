The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Clips project over the left lung, potentially within the breast. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. Chronic deformity of the posterior left sixth and seventh ribs are noted.\nImpression:\nNo acute cardiopulmonary process."

The heart is top normal in size.\nImpression:\nFocal consolidation at the left lung base, possibly representing aspiration or pneumonia.  Central vascular engorgement."

Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is stable.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged.  Small pleural effusion in the right middle fissure is new.  There is no new focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.\nImpression:\n1. Low lung volumes and mild pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged.   2.

There are a number of round nodular densities projecting over each upper lung, but more numerous and discretely visualized in the left upper lobe, similar to prior study.  However, in addition, there is a more hazy widespread opacity projecting over the left mid upper lung which could be compatible with a coinciding pneumonia.  Pulmonary nodules in the left upper lobe are also not completely characterized on this study.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Post-operative changes are similar along the right chest wall.\nImpression:\nIncreasing left lung opacification which may reflect pneumonia superimposed on metastatic disease, although other etiologies such as lymphangitic pattern of metastatic spread could be considered.  CT may be helpful to evaluate further if needed clinically."
